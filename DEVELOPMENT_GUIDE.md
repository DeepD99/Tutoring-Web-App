# Development Philosophy

## Code Quality Preferences
- Explain WHY solutions are structured a certain way
- Discuss alternative approaches and tradeoffs
- Include time/space complexity where relevant
- Flag common pitfalls
- Frame explanations for learning, not just working code
- Keep explanations concise - no lengthy paragraphs
